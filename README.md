# INTERESTING CODE CHALLENGES  

---  

A repository for keeping solutions to problems from different coding websites. I meant to store all code here and specially highlight some non-trivial, custom solutions to some of the challenges.  
It also serves a purpose of keeping me motivated to solve these challenges, code on a regular basis and keep on learning. I also hope that it may come in handy to anyone willing to compare these solutions or looking for a way to solve them. Code will be mainly in Python (majority) and C++ but some of the problems might be solved in other languages as well.  

In the specific directories there are more detailed README files describing each of the problems (code challenges).
