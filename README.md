# INTERESTING CODE CHALLENGES  

---  

A repository for keeping creative, non-trivial and interesting solutions to problems from different coding websites. It also serves a purpose of keeping me motivated to solve this challenges and keep on learning. I also hope that it may come in handy to anyone willing to compare these solutions or looking for one way to solve them. Code will be mainly in Python (majority) and C++ but some of the problems might be solved in other languages as well.  

In the specific directories there are more detailed README files describing each problem.
